Description: Efficient tabulation with Stata-like output.
	For each unique value of the variable, it shows the number of 
	observations with that value, proportion of observations with that
	value, and cumulative proportion, in descending order of frequency.
	Accepts data.table or tibble as input. 
	Efficient with big data: if you give it a data.table, 
	tab() uses data.table syntax.
Imports:
	dplyr,
	data.table,
	tibble,
	stringr,
	magrittr
Depends: R (>= 3.4.2)
